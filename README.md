Hello and welcome to my project portfolio. This holds a combination of my Grad projects as well as my personal projects, code mix of both R and Python. Key projects I would highlight would be the Black Jack Card Counting simulator (which uses complex Object Oriented Class systems), my Movie Recommendations Code (Which was built using collaborative filtering and deployed in an EC2 Instance) and Marketing Campaign Analysis (Business Insight focused project centered on delivering Actionable Business Insight). 

Additionally I have projects such as "Machine Learning Model Comparison" (Which looks at Grid Search and Pipeline Utilization from Sklearn), "Impact of College Earnings On Interest" (Focused on Models derived for Causal Analysis in an Econometrics project identifying factors that lead to college attendance interest), as well as "GDP Per Capita Forecasting" (Working with Time Series data and Lag- Adjusted models to predict Economic Conditions).
